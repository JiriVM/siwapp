Siwapp
======

* An open source web application meant to help manage & create invoices in a simple, straightforward way.*

The current version (on the site) is based on symfony1.  
The team has started to develop a new version based on symfony2, but didn't finish it.  
They opted to start to develop a new version in Ruby instead.

This repo is the latest branch - at the time of this writing- from the developer's svn, exported to remove all .svn files.
